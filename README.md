SCHEMA-RASPP
============

This is a software package for protein engineers. It uses protein structure and sequence information to aid researchers in designing protein recombination libraries.

These tools can calculate SCHEMA energies of chimeric proteins and run the RASPP algorithm to find optimal library designs. The package includes documentation and examples. 

SCHEMA was developed in the laboratory of Frances H. Arnold at the California Institute of Technology.
